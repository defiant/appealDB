        A database for Bridge Appeals
    </p>

    <div class="content">

        <p>The appealDB.com is intended as a platform where bridge people can browse, read and comment on appeals. </p>
        <p>This application tries to provide an archive for past bridge appeals.
            Although some Bridge Organizations post their appeals on web, they all do so, differently.
            As this platform will enable anyone (almost anyone) to enter appeals. We are hoping it will bring these appeal decisions to a brpader community.
            It will be possible to add and view appeal decisions from anywhere in the world.</p>
        <p>Another advantage of this approch is categorization; because all the appeals details are kept in a database,
            it will possible to search and categorize different appeals.</p>

        <h1 class="title">
            Adding an appeal to the database: <br>
        </h1>
        <p>At the moment all you need to do add a new appeal is to register and complete the appeal form.
            The registration is free and requires only a name an a valid address.
            <br>
            Once you are registered you can login and post an appeal right away.
            However keep in mind that we are still tinkering with the platform.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of the form is self explanatory and we included some texts describing what to do next to form elements. If you still have a question or anything else you want to say. Please contact us.
